# Review Session 4: Unsupervised Machine Learning @ Tools of Economic Complexity Analysis

The lab session contains two parts of materials and exercises in the Google Colab environment:

1. PCA+KMeans: [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DRthva1mPb2zZpYtCHi1JL9-r3M9lstC), [exercise](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_aywQjVtiHjG_ElG5KAdzbGi0SeRxif7), [answer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13P5S3T7BTfhPyyJ-85UNFsh1J8IHqXVg)
2. UMAP + HDBSCAN: [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TCxyDt2WHRx8TEBolqRFPCGFWlXIFsFk), [exercise](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-coSGfOAe0gbkTagYwyIQBRUJtzzfmmH), [answer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NsgzoreUihcIBhZsCwY_mRenkVbEDYBU)


For further unsupervised learning in python, you could check the textbook [Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) in **chapter 20-23**. The figures in the book and other supplementary materials are available on Colab through [this page](https://github.com/probml/pml-book/tree/main/pml1).
